Top-tier tools for the discerning D&amp;D DM

Naturalcrit is an organization created circa 2020, to keep maintenance of the Homebrewery, this is the repository that tracks the main website, naturalcrit.com.

naturalcrit.com holds the account system, so all accounts go through it, as of now, no other traffic runs through it.

While the site originaly had another tool called the badgeRender, but has been non-functional for years as of the writing of this article.

The current maintainer of this repository is @5e-Cleric, me, but anyone should be able to create pull requests or open issues. Please keep the issues in this repository about the account system or other related stuff, for issues about the homebrewery or any other tool, open them in their respective repository.
